**Github workflow**

Do not commit directly to Master
Use pull requests on the repo
Use a feature branch for any changes - repo/feature_branch

When changes are ready to be merged in Master create a pull request to start a conversation with Team. Use @mentions to message team.

The pull request should be from the feature_branch into Master.
Use a single repo for collaboration

feature_branches should be between 1-5 days no longer and should be cxreated for single changes. Pull requests should be started to early in the process to start the communication
